- ✅ Built login and registration pages
- ✅ Updated dashboard with proper UI
- ✅ Configured network settings for phone-to-PC connection

### ✓ **Build & Deployment Scripts**

- ✅ `build_apk.sh` - Build APK with guided setup
- ✅ Modified Flask to allow network connections (`host='0.0.0.0'`)

### ✓ **Documentation**
- ✅ `MOBILE_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide (5 steps)
- ✅ `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions
- ✅ `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Full API reference
- ✅ `README.md` - Flutter app documentation

## 🚀 **How to Use It**

### **Option 1: Run on Phone via USB** (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# Step 1: Connect phone via USB with USB debugging enabled

# Step 2: Run the auto-setup script
cd /home/adnan/staffroom
./run_mobile_dev.sh

# Step 3: Run the app
cd flutter/teacher
flutter run
```

**That's it!** The script handles everything automatically.

### **Option 2: Build APK** (For Installing Without USB)

```bash
# Build APK with guided setup
cd /home/adnan/staffroom
./build_apk.sh

# The APK will be at:
# flutter/teacher/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Install via USB:
adb install flutter/teacher/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Or download via browser:
cd flutter/teacher/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk
python3 -m http.server 8000
# On phone: http://YOUR_PC_IP:8000/app-release.apk
```

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Network Setup (Already Configured!)**

The scripts handle this automatically, but if you need to manually configure:

**1. Find your PC's IP:**
```bash
hostname -I
# Example: 192.168.1.100
```

**2. Update Flutter app:**
Edit `flutter/teacher/lib/services/api_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.100:5000';  // Your PC IP
```

**3. Ensure Flask allows network access:**
Already done! `web_app.py` now has `host='0.0.0.0'`

---

## 📋 **Prerequisites Checklist**

Before running the app, ensure:

**One-time Setup:**
- [ ] Flutter installed: `sudo snap install flutter --classic`
- [ ] Verify: `flutter doctor`

**Phone Setup:**
- [ ] USB debugging enabled (Settings → Developer Options)
- [ ] Phone connected via USB
- [ ] Phone and PC on same WiFi (for network access)

**Backend Setup:**
- [ ] Flask server running: `python3 web_app.py`
- [ ] Firewall allows port 5000: `sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp`

---

## 🎯 **Quick Start Commands**

### **Super Quick Start:**
```bash
./run_mobile_dev.sh    # Does everything!
cd flutter/teacher
flutter run            # Run on phone
```

### **Build APK:**
```bash
./build_apk.sh         # Guided APK build
```

### **Manual Commands:**
```bash
# Find PC IP
hostname -I

# Check phone connected
flutter devices

# Run on phone
cd flutter/teacher
flutter run

# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Install APK
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# View logs
flutter logs
```

---

## 🔐 **Demo Credentials**

```
Username: teacher
Password: teacher123
```

---

## ✨ **What's Working**

### **✅ Fully Functional:**
- Login/Logout
- Registration
- Session management
- API communication
- Network connectivity
- Dashboard UI
- Navigation menu

### **🚧 Placeholder (UI only, no backend yet):**
- Classes page
- Organizations page
- Discussions page
- Resources page
- Schedule page
- Students page

Your junior created the UI, I've added:
- Complete API integration
- Authentication system
- Network configuration
- Build tools & scripts
- Full documentation

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Can't connect to server?**
```bash
# 1. Check Flask is running
lsof -i:5000

# 2. Test from phone browser
http://YOUR_PC_IP:5000

# 3. Allow firewall
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp

# 4. Verify same WiFi
# PC and phone must be on same network
```

### **Phone not detected?**
```bash
# 1. Check USB debugging enabled
# 2. Reconnect USB cable
# 3. Check connection
flutter devices
adb devices

# 4. Accept prompt on phone
```

### **Build fails?**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter doctor -v
```

### **App crashes?**
```bash
# Check logs
flutter logs
adb logcat | grep flutter

# Verify configuration
cat flutter/teacher/lib/services/api_config.dart | grep baseUrl
```

## 💡 **Key Points**

1. **Network Requirements:**
   - Phone and PC must be on **same WiFi**
   - Flask must run with `host='0.0.0.0'` ✓ (already configured)
   - Firewall must allow port 5000

2. **API Configuration:**
   - Use PC's IP for local testing
   - Use production URL for deployed app
   - Scripts auto-configure for you!

3. **Development Workflow:**
   - Use `flutter run` for development (hot reload!)
   - Build APK for testing without USB
   - Deploy to cloud for production access

---

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

Everything is configured and ready to go. Just run:
