# üì± Manual Steps to Run Mobile App

## üéØ Simple Steps (Do These in Order)

### Step 1: Start Flask Server

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd /home/adnan/staffroom
python3 web_app.py
```

**Keep this terminal open!** You should see:
```
üöÄ StaffRoom Server Starting
* Running on http://192.168.1.13:5000
```

### Step 2: Test from Phone Browser

On your phone browser, visit:
```
http://192.168.1.13:5000
```

You should see the StaffRoom login page. If you don't:
- Check both devices are on SAME WiFi
- Check firewall: `sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp`

### Step 3: Download New APK

Open **another terminal** (don't close Flask!) and run:

```bash
cd /home/adnan/staffroom/flutter/teacher/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

On phone browser:
```
http://192.168.1.13:8000/app-release.apk
```

### Step 4: Install APK

1. **Uninstall old StaffRoom app** (if installed)
2. **Install new APK** you just downloaded
3. **Open app**
4. **Login:** teacher / teacher123
